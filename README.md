## DEV x AssemblyAI Challenge Submission

**Track:** Business Automation Voice Agent  
**Title:** ZenVA – AI-Powered Voice Personal Assistant  
**Demo:** [Live Demo](https://lovable.dev/projects/3fa23bf9-eab5-40c5-b47b-573852c086f9)  
**GitHub Repo:** [GitHub](https://github.com/your-username/zenva-voice-assistant)  

### Description:
ZenVA is an AI-powered personal assistant that automates productivity and daily planning through real-time voice interaction. By leveraging AssemblyAI's ultra-fast Universal-Streaming API, ZenVA captures spoken input, processes it through an intelligent LLM agent (GROQ + RAG), and automates tasks, reminders, focus sessions, and summaries. It helps users stay on top of their goals with voice-driven automation.

## Features

- 🎤 **Real-Time Voice Commands** – Powered by AssemblyAI Universal-Streaming for instant transcription
- 📅 **Smart Scheduling Assistant** – Automatically create reminders and to-dos from voice
- 🧠 **LLM-Powered Task Planning** – Converts your speech into structured plans using RAG
- ✅ **Context-Aware Task Manager** – Organizes and prioritizes tasks intelligently
- 🧘 **Focus & Break Guidance** – Voice coaching to manage deep work sessions
- 📝 **Voice Notes with Summaries** – Real-time voice note transcription with smart highlights
- 🧾 **Meeting Minutes Generator** – Transcribe, summarize, and organize your meetings on the fly

## Use Case Examples

- Say: "Remind me to call John at 3PM tomorrow." → It adds a reminder.
- Say: "What's on my to-do list for today?" → It reads back your agenda.
- Say: "Summarize my last focus session." → You get a voice-based report.
- Say: "Take a note: Meeting with Sarah went well. Discussed Q3 goals." → Creates and stores a summarized note.

## Powered by AssemblyAI

ZenVA uses AssemblyAI's Universal-Streaming API to transcribe voice in real-time with <300ms latency, allowing fast and natural interaction with the AI assistant. The transcription data is then used to:

- Trigger task creation or reminders
- Perform NLP parsing for intent detection
- Pass to GROQ + RAG for intelligent response

## Tech Stack

- 🧠 OpenAI / GROQ + RAG for NLP
- 🎙️ AssemblyAI Universal-Streaming API for voice transcription
- ⚡ Supabase for real-time data + edge functions
- ⚛️ React + Vite + TypeScript + shadcn-ui for UI
